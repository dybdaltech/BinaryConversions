# BinaryConversions

Created while waiting for work things..
Its messy, mistakes were made.

Run Script.py with either "-b" to convert from binary to text, or "-t" to convert text to binary.

Example:

```$.\script.py -t "Long text to convert into binary"```

Or 

```$.\script.py -b "1000010 1101001 1101110 1100001 1110010 1111001"```
